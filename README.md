## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸ”­  Iâ€™ve built **distributed systems at AWS (EBS team)**, where I designed Rust-based daemons to refresh multi-GB datasets, reducing CPU spikes and        saving ~$400k annually in projected costs.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving deeper into fault-tolerant distributed architectures, ML-driven systems optimization, and large-scale data pipelines.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m exploring consensus algorithms, stream processing, and efficient model deployment in distributed environments.
