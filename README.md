## Hi there 👋
My name is Shawn, and I’m a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech passionate about Python, Machine Learning, and distributed systems. I enjoy building scalable software and applying AI to solve real-world problems!
  - 🔭  I’ve worked on **distributed systems at AWS (EBS team)**, where I designed Rust-based daemons to refresh multi-GB datasets, reducing CPU spikes and        saving ~$400k annually in projected costs.  
  - 🌱 I’m diving deeper into fault-tolerant distributed architectures, ML-driven systems optimization, and large-scale data pipelines.
  - 🤔 I’m exploring consensus algorithms, stream processing, and efficient model deployment in distributed environments.
